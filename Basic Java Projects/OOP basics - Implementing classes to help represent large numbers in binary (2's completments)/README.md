# Assignment 4 -OOP basics - Implementing classes to help represent large numbers in binary (2's completments).

## Overview:
In this assignment we've contunied to work with classes, implementing and overwriting inherited functions, implementing different builders and more.

#### Task1 & Task2 - Implementing Bit and BitList classes:
In those tasks wev'e continued to implement Bit class and added a new class "BitList". those classe's goal is to help us represent big values of numbers similarly to "Big Integer" Java's class.

#### Task3 - Implementing the class "Binary Number":
Binary Number object will represent a binary number in 2's completments, using Bit and BitList classes from previouse tasks.
