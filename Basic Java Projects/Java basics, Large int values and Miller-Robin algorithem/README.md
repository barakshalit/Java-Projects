# Assignment 1 - Java basics, handeling large Int values, finding if a number is prime or not and using probability (Miller- Robin algorithem) to do so with large numbers.

## Overview:
In this assignment we've got to know the basic of Java and implemented some basic logics.

#### Task1 - warmup:
Implementng basic If conditions.

#### Task2 - warmup:
Implementing random number generator from range fiven from the user.

#### Task3a:
Getting input from the user and return 2^n (handeling INT type limits).

#### Task3b:
Gettin from the user n,k and returning the value of 2^n%k for any value of n,k (handeling int limits).

#### Task4a:
Getting int input from user and deciding if the integer is prime or not.

#### Task4b:
Getting int input from the user and returning all the prime numbers that are smaller or equal to the input. 

#### Task4c + Task4d + Task4e + Task4f:
Implementing Miller-Robin algorithem to determine if a number is prime or not (handeling large numbers with the help of probability).
